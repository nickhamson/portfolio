Whether you're new to programming in R or are an experienced user, knowing how to effectively visualize data is an essential skill. A table full of numbers or a poorly made chart might be difficult to interpret, misleading, or, worst of all, boring to your audience. The ggplot2 package provides tools to create deliverable-quality graphics that accurately reflect your data and analysis. Let's dive in to some of the basics of using ggplot!

&nbsp;
# The ggplot Function and Layers
Every graphic we'll make with ggplot2 starts with the `ggplot()` function. The most common arguments are the dataframe that holds our data and a call to the `aes()` function to specify x and y axes. Let's take a look with the `mtcars` dataset.
```
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")

ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg))
```
This says we want to plot data from mtcars with engine displacement on the x-axis and miles per gallon on the y-axis. If you're coding along and you run this block, you get... nothing. We need to include one or more layers or *geoms* to the initial function call to specify what kind of plot we want.
```
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point(color = "red")
```
The `geom_point()` function creates a scatter plot of the points we want, and we specified that the points should be red.

Now we're getting somewhere! If we want more features in the plot, we can add more geoms. Let's use `geom_smooth()` to insert a line of best-fit.
```
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point(color = "red") +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkred")
```
Our plot now shows our best-fit line for a linear model, with error bands, in dark red.

# Adding Other Features
We can continue chaining on function calls to include more features to our plot. *mpg* and *disp* aren't very descriptive, and our graph needs a title. Let's use the `labs()` function to provide labels for the `title`, `subtitle`, `x`, and `y` parameters.

We can also modify our `aes()` call to show more specific information. We'll include `color` as a parameter dependent on the number of cylinders.
```
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = cyl)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Miles/Gallon vs Engine Displacement",
    subtitle = "Data from 1974 Motor Trend Magazine",
    x = "Engine displacement (cu. in.)",
    y = "Miles per gallon") +
```
To change the label on the legend, we can include `scale_color_discrete()`.
```
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Cylinders")
```
Let's see the final product!

I hope this tutorial has taught you something about ggplot2 or at least refreshed your memory! Clearly communicating results is the final step of any analysis; if it's not done properly, all the work beforehand loses its impact. What do you think about when you're creating graphics? We've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with ggplot2, are there other features that you use regularly? Share your thoughts down below!
