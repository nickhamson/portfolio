Whether you're new to programming in R or are an experienced user, knowing how to effectively visualize data is an essential skill. A table full of numbers or a poorly made chart might be difficult to interpret, misleading, or, worst of all, boring to your audience. The ggplot2 package provides tools to create deliverable-quality graphics that accurately reflect your data and analysis. Let's dive in to some of the basics of using ggplot!

&nbsp;
## The ggplot Function and Layers
Every graphic we'll make with ggplot2 starts with the `ggplot()` function. The most common arguments are the dataframe that holds our data and a call to the `aes()` function to specify x and y axes. Let's take a look with the `mtcars` dataset:
```
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")

ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg))
```
This says we want to plot data from mtcars with engine displacement on the x-axis and miles per gallon on the y-axis. If you're coding along and you run this block, you get... nothing. We need to include one or more layers or *geoms* to the initial function call to specify what kind of plot we want:
```
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point(color = "red")
```
The `geom_point()` function
