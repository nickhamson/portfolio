Whether you're new to programming in R or are an experienced user, knowing how to effectively visualize data is an essential skill. A table full of numbers or a poorly made chart might be difficult to interpret, misleading, or, worst of all, boring to your audience. The ggplot2 package provides tools to create deliverable-quality graphics that accurately reflect your data and analysis. Let's dive in to some of the basics of using ggplot!

&nbsp;
# The ggplot Function and Layers
Every graphic we'll make with ggplot2 starts with the `ggplot()` function. The most common arguments are the dataframe that holds our data and a call to the `aes()` function to specify x and y axes. Let's take a look with the `mtcars` dataset.
```
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")

ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg))
```
This says we want to plot data from mtcars with engine displacement on the x-axis and miles per gallon on the y-axis. If you're coding along and you run this block, you get... nothing. We need to include one or more layers or *geoms* to the initial function call to specify what kind of plot we want.
```
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point(color = "red")
```
The `geom_point()` function creates a scatter plot of the points we want, and we specified that the points should be red.

Now we're getting somewhere! If we want more features in the plot, we can add more geoms. Let's use `geom_smooth()` to insert a line of best-fit.
```
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point(color = "red") +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkred")
```
Our plot now shows our best-fit line for a linear model, with error bands, in dark red.
